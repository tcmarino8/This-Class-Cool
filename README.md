Bootstrapping, Bayesian Evidence

Bootstapping: the act of resampling data. shifting up the order and where the data points appear.
  Good for allowing you to work with more data. We do this for parameter estimation of super nova data. Finding 1000 optimal omega and w values with bootstrapped data and then averaging over all the optimals.
  
  Bayesian Evidence is a little bit beyond me to be honest. It seems you take a prior and a likelihood and you can approcimate the evidence using laplace approximtion.
